You should write it as if it's an “early draft\" of what will turn into your final project. You can write it as if you're writing the first few pages of your final project report, so that you can re-use most of the milestone text in your final report. Thus, for example, you should not spend two pages explaining what logistic regression is. Note: We will expect your final writeup to be on the same topic as your milestone.\n",

Depending on available space, show some examples from your dataset. You should also talk about the features you used.

For example, you can briefly include the SVM optimization objective/formula or say what the softmax function is. It is okay to use formulas from the lecture notes. For each algorithm, give a short description $(\\approx 1$ paragraph) of how it works. Again, we are looking for your understanding of how these machine learning algorithms work. Although the teaching staff probably know the algorithms, future readers may not (reports will be posted on the class website). Additionally, if you are using a niche or cutting-edge algorithm (e.g. long short-term memory, SURF features, or anything else not covered in the class), you may want to explain your algorithm using $1 / 2$ paragraphs. Note: Theory/algorithms projects may have an appendix showing extended proofs (see Appendix section below)."

Did you do cross-validation, if so, how many folds? Before you list your results, make sure to list and explain what your primary metrics are: accuracy, precision, AUC, etc. Provide equations for the metrics if necessary. For results, you want to have a mixture of tables and plots. If you are solving a classification problem, you should include a confusion matrix or AUC/AUPRC curves. Include performance metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy. For regression problems, state the average error. You should have both quantitative and qualitative results. To reiterate, you must have both quantitative and qualitative results! This includes unsupervised learning (talk with your project TA on how to quantify unsupervised methods). Include visualizations of results, heatmaps, examples of where your algorithm failed and a discussion of why certain algorithms failed or succeeded. In addition, explain whether you think you have overfit to your training set and what, if anything, you did to mitigate that. Make sure to discuss the figures/tables in your main text throughout this section. Your plots should include legends, axis labels, and have font sizes that are legible when printed."
